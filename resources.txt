Before attempting this project, I completed the Udacity JavaScript Testing
course.  Luckily, I spent some serious time researching and resolving
issues around asynchronous functions and responses for Project 5, so
the information I learned from that project was immediately useful for
this next project!  I also used the Introduction to Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html) as well as other GitHub resources.

This project was helpful in getting a new perspective on code development.
In essence, it flipped the paradigm to give some insights into developing
defensively:)

Honestly, most of the work was already done for us in this project, so
it was a good opportunity to regroup at the end and reflect on different ways
to approach development.

Thanks for taking the time to review my project!
